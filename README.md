# pyCV
Python implementations of famous Computer Vision algorithms.

## SIFT: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform
Identifying stable features in images that are invariant to changes in scale and luminosity.

### Notes
These implementations were made to be lucid and understandable instead of acutely efficient. Use them at your own risk.  
You might be interested in [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) for more performant implementations.
