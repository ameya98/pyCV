# pyCV
Python implementations of famous Computer Vision algorithms.

## SIFT: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform
Identifying stable features in images that are invariant to changes in object position, scale and luminosity.
A work in progress

## Note
These implementations served as learning experiences, and not to be the most efficient.  
You might be interested in [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) for more performant implementations.
